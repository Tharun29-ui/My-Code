    <p>Sting like a bee."- Bumblebee after he shot Quintessa

        Bumblebee is a main deuteragonist of Transformers films and main protagonist of Bumblebee films He is one of Optimus Prime's most trusted lieutenants. Although he's not the strongest or most powerful of the Autobots, Bumblebee more than makes up for this with a bottomless well of luck, determination and bravery. He would gladly give his life to protect others and stop the Decepticons.
        
        Because Megatron took his voice box, Bumblebee unfortunately lost the ability to speak verbally, though he can still communicate over inter-Autobot frequencies (in a fashion that seems somewhat akin to instant messaging, a usable but more distant and less personal means of interaction). He can also communicate with the Autobots' human allies and his friend, Sam Witwicky, by playing audio clips from popular media on his radio.
        
        He is also known as N.B.E.-02 and has operated under the codenames ZB-7, Goldwheels and B-127. He is also partnered with the Dinobot Strafe, and is brothers-in-arms with fellow Autobot Hot Rod..</p>
